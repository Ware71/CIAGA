# CIAGA – AI Working Rules

- Prefer the smallest possible diff.
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase.
- Do not add dependencies unless asked.
- Do not touch env files/secrets without asking.
- Before coding: search the repo and state what files you’ll edit.
- After coding: list changed files + why, and tell me what to run (lint/tests).
- If there are multiple approaches, pick the simplest.
